This folder contains examples of files containing the polygons drawn by a user of the SPACE labelling tool. When using the program for the first time two files are created, a "selected_polygons.txt" and "PolygonData.json." The ".txt" file contains the name along the maximum and minimum frequency and time of each polygon drawn by the user. The ".json" file follows the TFCat format for feature catalogues. It contains meta data such as the units of measurement, the name of the observer, and feature numbers along with the time-frequency coordinates of each vertex of each polygon that has been drawn. The time is saved in the Unix timestamp format while the frequency is saved in the same units as the frequency specified by the data file used for plotting.

The SPACE labelling tool will update these files at each time of running and hence it must be made aware that if changing to a new data set / instrument, the "selected_polygons.txt" and "polygonData.json" files must either be renamed or moved to another directory to avoid cross contamination between different data sources. 

NOTE: the SPACE labelling tool determines whethere to create or update an existing file based on the presence (or lack thereof) of the ".txt" file, and hence, if this is present in the local directory and the ".json" file is not, an error will be raised when trying to save the polygon data to the files.
